## 0: Prepare to Run at NERSC

Tutorials intended to be run via a jupyter session at NERSC require some initial setup.  Detailed instructions are [here](NERSC.md)

## 1: Simulate Realistic Galaxies

Since this tutorial is intended to be run at NERSC, you will need to complete Step-0 first.

Instructions for generating the image and catalog used in Step-2 are [here](WLD.md).  For a general tutorial introduction to the WeakLensingDeblending package, start [here](http://weaklensingdeblending.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html).

## 2: Process Realistic Galaxies with the DM Pipeline

Since this tutorial is intended to be run at NERSC, you will need to complete Step-0 first.

Navigate to your `Blending_tutorial` directory in the jupyter browser, and click on the `Process.ipynb` notebook to launch this tutorial.

## 3: Process Isolated Galaxy Pairs with the DM Pipeline

Since this tutorial is intended to be run at NERSC, you will need to complete Step-0 first.

Navigate to your `Blending_tutorial` directory in the jupyter browser, and click on the `Two_galaxy_blends.ipynb` notebook to launch this tutorial.

## 4: Analyze Realistic Blended Galaxies

This step can either be run at NERSC or on your laptop by downloading files saved from the earlier steps. All our data products can be found at NERSC in `/global/projecta/projectdirs/lsst/groups/WL/projects/wl-btf/`.

Open the `Example_analysis.ipynb` notebook to launch this tutorial.

## 5: Analyze Isolated Blended Galaxy Pairs

This step can either be run at NERSC or on your laptop by downloading files saved from the earlier steps. All our data products can be found at NERSC in `/global/projecta/projectdirs/lsst/groups/WL/projects/wl-btf/`.
